    "* Module 1 - non-personalized keyword-filtering recommender:<br>\n",
    "build keyword search-based restaurant recommender module to filter by keyword. Keywords could include, for instance, location-based information (zip code, longitude, latitude)  and restaurant feature-based information (cuisine, style). \n",
    "The restaurant inventory will be filtered by keywords first, then ranked by its average rating or weighted smart rating taking into consideration the popularity (depending on user’s choice). The top-k restaurants from the list will be returned as the top-k recommendations.<br>\n",
    "* Module 2 - personalized content-based recommender:<br>\n",
    "With user ID and restaurant’s metadata, build a content based recommender module that recommends restaurants that are similar to user’s preference inferred from user’s past ratings. More specifically, pairwise similarity scores will be computed for restaurants based on their vectorized feature representation extracted using CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer and recommend restaurants based on rankings of the weighted similarity score (e.g. cosine similarity). The important restaurant metadata to consider include categories, attributes, location.<br>\n",
    "* Module 3 - personalized collaborative recommender:<br>\n",
    "With user_id x restaurant_id rating matrix, build a collaborative recommender module. Remember that the dataset has a total of 1,518,169 users, 188,593 businesses and 5,996,995 reviews. In terms of the user_id x business_id matrix, the matrix is very sparse (0.003% non-empty). Therefore, matrix factorization algorithms will be used to complete the highly sparse matrix and generate recommendations.<br>\n",
    "* Metrics chosen for evaluating and optimizing the ‘goodness’ of the algorithms:<br>\n",
    "a) measure prediction accuracy: RMSE(root mean squared error) <br>\n",
    "b) measure ranking effectiveness: NDCG(Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) at top-k<br>\n",
    "* Integration - combine the above modules to build a hybrid recommendation engine:<br>\n",
    "To combine the above modules, a few simple interactive questions will be added:<br>\n",
    "a) “Want customized recommendations based on your user history by providing your user ID?”  If no, activate the simple recommender module to provide base-case recommendations using location information and/or optional keywords<br>\n",
    "b) If yes, prompt to ask follow up question: “do you want to try something new based on people like you?” If yes, activate the collaborative filtering module to recommend new restaurants based on similar peers; otherwise, use content filter module to recommend similar restaurants. <br>\n",
    "* Other improvements:<br>\n",
    "Optimize restaurant ranking by weighting the average rating based on total number of ratings (popularity), weighting the individual rating according to their recency, etc. With a quick interactive question: “want smart rating instead?” The alternative restaurant ranking method based on the above weighted scores will be activated and used instead of the simple average rating.<br>\n",
    "* Potential caveats - cold start problem:<br>\n",
    "a) new restaurant → content-based recommendation module will be able to use the features (metadata) of the new restaurant and include it when generating recommendations.<br>\n",
    "b) new user → will be treated as if the user ID is not available (both has no user history) and similar recommender module will be used to recommend restaurants based on location, keywords, popularity, etc. \n",
