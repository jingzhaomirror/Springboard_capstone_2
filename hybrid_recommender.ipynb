    "## 2. Build user interface for supporting user interactions with the recommendation engine\n",
    "(section 3)\n",
    "To wrap up the above modules and support user interactions, a user interface is constructed by implementing several interactive questions to gather user interests and navigate through the recommendation engine:<br>\n",
    "* **\"Want to try a customized recommendation based on your Yelp user history?\"**<br>\n",
    "If no, proceed with the non-personalized keyword-filtering recommender module. First, gather user's keywords indicating user's interests, then filter the restaurant catalog by keywords to provide the non-personalized recommendations; if yes, prompt to collect user id and ask followup question to decide which personalized module to use.<br>\n",
    "* **\"Wanna rank your recommendations by 'smart' ratings?\"**<br>\n",
    "The non-personalized keyword-filtering module supports two different ranking mechanisms:<br>\n",
    "    1. rank by the 'smart' rating: the original restaurnat average star rating is weighted by taking into consideration the number of ratings it receives ('restaurant popularity'); the adjusted rating is then used for ranking.<br>\n",
    "    2. rank by the original star rating: the original restaurant average star rating is used for ranking.<br>   \n",
    "* **\"Which personalized recommendation would you prefer?\"**\n",
    "The personalized recommendation can be generated via two different modules: <br>\n",
    "    1. \"Something new based on people like you\": if 1, activate the collaborative module to recommend new restaurants based on similar peers <br>\n",
    "    2. \"Something similar to your favorate restaurants\": if 2, activate the content-based module to recommend similar restaurants based on user's favorates<br>\n",
    "* **\"Would you like to further filter your recommendation results by keywords?\"**<br>\n",
    "The recommendation engine supports further filtering the recommendation results with keywords. If yes, gather user's filtering keywords, then run the non-personalized keyword-filtering module on the recommendation list to further filter the list.<br> \n",
    "* **\"Would you like to display more/less recommendation results?\"**<br>\n",
    "The recommendation engine also supports displaying the top-n recommendation results with the user's choice of n. If yes, gather user's choice of n and display the top-n restaurants from the recommendation list.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note \n",
    "Only a subset of Yelp restaurants from a few selected states are available in this dataset. Among them, only Arizona, Nevada, Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania have a rich catalog of over 5000 restaurants."
