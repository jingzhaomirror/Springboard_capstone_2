    "# Recommender system - non-personalized keyword-search recommender module\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction ##\n",
    "A keyword search-based restaurant recommender module is built to filter by keywords of interest. Keyword-search module should support filtering by both restaurant location-based keywords(zip code, longitude, latitude) and restaurant feature-based keywords (cuisine, style, price). The restaurant catalog will be filtered by keywords first, then ranked by the appropriate ranking metrics of user's choice.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary ##\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Laying the groundworks:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating geodesic distance:\n",
    "In order to compute the distance between a restaurant and the location of user's interest, a function needs to be implemented for calculating the geodesic distances between two points on a globe given their coordinates. Two different methods are implemented and compared: <br> \n",
    "1. the great circle distance calculated assuming a spherical model of the earth<br>\n",
    "2. the geodesic distance calculated by Vincenty formula based on a more accurate ellipsoidal model of the earth<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The results show that the great-circle distance is reasonably accurate when compared with the geodesic distance calculated from an ellipsoidal model of the earth. Given that calculating great-circle distance is at least 100 times faster on average, therefore the great-circle distance is chosen in this project for calculating the distance give two geocoordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Geopy.geocoders for identifying the geocoordinates for the location of interest:\n",
    "In order to compute the distance between restaurants and user's location of interest using geocoordinates, the 'geocoders' module from the 'geopy' package is selected and tested for translating the location of user's interest in the format of zipcode/city/state into geocoordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjusted rating:\n",
    "An adjusted rating score is introduced as an improved metric to replace the original restaurant average star rating.\n",
    "$$score_i = \\frac{\\sum_u r_{ui} + k*\\mu}{n_i+k}$$\n",
    "The adjusted score uses the mechanism of the damped mean to regulate the extreme cases of having only a few extreme ratings. k controls the strength of the damping effect: the larger k is, the more actual ratings are required to overcome the global mean. In this case, k is set to 22 (which is the 50% quantile of the review counts for all businesses), but it can be tuned according to various business considerations.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The results indicate that the new metric improves the original rating by taking into consideration both:<br>\n",
    "1) average rating of the restaurant (indicates the goodness of the restaurant, but does not consider popularity)<br>\n",
    "2) # of ratings by users (indicates popularity, but does not imply the goodness of the restaurant)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Implementation & testing of the non-personalized keyword-search recommender module:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementaion of keyword-search recommender module:**<br> \n",
    "The restaurant catalog is first filtered by all the keywords indicating user's interests, then ranked by the user-selected ranking criteria. Lastly, the top-n restaurants from the ranked list are returned with the user's choice of n. For the ranking criteria, both the restaurant original average star rating and the newly introduced weighted rating are implemented and available to users via the module interface.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Testing:**<br>\n",
    "Module testing shows that the average time of computing and returning the recommendation takes about 1-2 seconds. The returning results only include restaurants matching all keywords.<br>"
